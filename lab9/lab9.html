		<p><h2>What is IU-READY?</h2>
		IU-READY is a Pre-Course Readiness Assessment for Distance Education (DE) courses offered at IU South Bend. The
		development of this system was proposed by Drs. Hossein Hakimzadeh and Marianne Castano Bishop to Dr. Alfred
		J.Guillaume Jr. (Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs) and the Academic Cabinet at IU South Bend in
		September 2011. The rationale for developing such a system was based on the analysis of past DFW (grades D, F, and
		Withdraw) data from the Registrar’s Office which showed that certain student populations were specially underprepared to
		take online classes. It was argued that a better system for identifying these students would be in their best interest.</p><br>

		<p>Similar to other assessment tools (e.g., math or English placement exams), IU-READY assessment should be used by every student
		prior to registering for an online course. The IU-READY for DE assessment instrument will present the student with a
		number of questions and subsequently produces a report for each student (and other constituencies such as faculty and
		administrators of the DE program) letting the student know why an online course may or may not be a suitable option 
		for him/her at this point in time.</p><br>
		
		<p>The IU-READY for DE self-assessment instrument will take 
		approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete and is comprised of questions from the following categories:
		<ol>
			<li>Access and proficiency in the use of proper technology for online study (e.g., proper computer equipment, high
		speed Internet access, proficiency with course management systems, etc.)</li>
			<li>Ability to type with speed and accuracy</li>
			<li>Ability to read and interpret instructions, and apply higher order thinking skills with course content</li>
			<li>Ability to read, understand, recall, and summarize information</li>
			<li>Learning style (structured lecture, cooperative and group activity, auditory, visual, tactile, etc.)</li>
			<li>Study skills (e.g., note taking, time management, etc.)</li>
			<li>Other life factors affecting student’s ability to succeed in online study (e.g., work, family, commute, other
		obligations)</li>
			<li>Motivation and maturity, self discipline, realistic expectation</li>
		</ol>
